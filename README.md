Welcome to the Readable Application. This tool will allow you to create a blog
of your own. Create posts and let the users comment on them. Hope this tool
let you start a world of discussion and healthy debating.

## Installation

Before installing the application, you should follow the following url to install
the api required to make the app to work. Once you finish installing it and running
it, you can continue with the following steps.

* Follow the instructions on this repository [API][Create React App]
(https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter/tree/master/api-server)

After you have installed the api, clone the readable repository to your computer,
or download the zip file and on the folder root where you copied, follow these steps:

* Run `npm install` to download all the libraries needed on the app.
* Once all the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running
`npm start`

Once the application has been compiled, a browser window will pop up and you can
start using the application right away.
